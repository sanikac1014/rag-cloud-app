They are reviewed, researched and updated by Analytic Specialist to assure the data accuracy. Additional value-added data gathered by Analytical Specialists includes, among other things, completion dates, square footage, subclasses, opening date for hotels and units for nontraditional residential buildings like hotels and senior housing. Hotel and Retail Brands Brand names are given for retail and hotel properties when available. For example, REA subscribers have an ability retrieve only Hilton Hotels, rather than all hotels, or CVS, rather than all retail properties. We currently track 307 hotel brands and 1073 retail brands. Two Unique Stages REA reports and tracks construction projects through nine different phases: pre-planning, planning, final planning, bidding, start, underway, completed, deferred, and abandoned. We estimate the target completion dates for the project that broke ground by using the methodology we developed internally if the target completion is not filled by Dodge Reporters. Later, we verify the completion date two months before to the target date for the projects valued at 20 million and over (Value criteria is $10 million and over for hotels). In addition, we verify the target start date for the projects valued $20 million and over. Geo-coding All US projects in REA are given latitude and longitude co-ordinates and the degree to which a project has been geocoded. Geo-coding data helps our subscribers to identify projects in a specific real estate submarket. Subclasses: Each property class is made up of more narrowly defined subclasses in REA. This gives commercial real estate companies an easy way to assess the coming supply by breaking out high-rise office buildings from all office buildings, apartment or townhouse/condo projects from total multifamily, community centers from total retail, etc.",

      "longDescription": "How Our Curbside Pickup Solution Works: The customer places an online order on the retailer\u2019s website or mobile app and selects the option for curbside pickup at a specific retailer\u2019s store location. Once the customer places an order, an email is sent notifying the customer the order was received and that the order is being processed. If placing the order through the mobile app, the integrated curbside service SDK is triggered which begins monitoring GPS position of the device \u2013 prompting for any permissions needed. When the order is ready, the customer receives an email from the retailer notifying them the item(s) is ready for pickup. Upon arrival, the customer calls the store or clicks a link in the store\u2019s email. The employee brings out the item(s). If the customer has the retailer\u2019s app, geofencing will automatically notify the store when the customer arrives. After the customer has picked up the item(s), the customer receives an email from the retailer that they have picked up the item(s) with a receipt and details of the purchase. Technical Details Involved: Integration of 3rd party curbside service SDK into native mobile Android/iOS app code, including triggering curbside orders on checkout and requesting vehicle information. Work with internal development/business teams to implement a dynamic UI element/modal in native app(s) to show current curbside status/arrival CTAs. Coordination of internal business teams for location data mapping and per-location geofence painting guidelines. Development and deployment of a \u201cwebhook\u201d service API that can handle curbside service SDK ETA updates from customer devices and proxy them to internal systems as needed. Webhook service would be hosted via an AWS serverless stack (API Gateway, Lambda) to scale appropriately with incoming ETA and arrival event data. Modification of in-store pickup order application to include curbside data: vehicle information, ETA/arrival status. All communication between mobile clients, websites, and internal systems into/within/and outside of AWS secured via SSL. Any information stored in AWS-deployed resources (including RDS or ElastiCache) to have encryption enabled in-transit and at-rest, as applicable. Time Estimation: Estimated 1,000 manhours total (four full-time resources for six weeks, plus an extra 40 hours for project management, oversight, etc.) Two full-time app developers Two full-time API developers Assume four developers based on need, e.g., the in-store app might be a mobile app and not a web app, so this situation would translate to three UI developers and one API developer, etc. Project Assumptions: Existing app with checkout API integration already functional In-store app to manage pickup orders is currently in place; only modifications to support curbside-specific information needed In-store inventory is taken into account with pickup orders Available Add-Ons: In-store Pager system integration Map view of arriving/nearby/parked customers Additional UI development to support entering \u201cparked\u201d metadata in app, and including that in the in-store app \u2013 e.g., parking lot location/space number If no store pickup business process or app is currently in place, additional development will be needed to create a basic pickup order management app for use by employees to manage preparing, picking, and updating the status of pickup orders.

The Hospital Value Based Purchasing (HVBP) Program is a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initiative that rewards acute care hospitals with incentive payments for the quality of care they provide to Medicare beneficiaries. CMS rewards hospitals based on the quality of care provided to Medicare patients, closely best clinical practices and well hospitals enhance patients experiences of care during hospital stays. Hospital Compare Clinical Process of Care Efficiency Scores contains a list of hospitals participating in the Hospital Value Based Purchasing Program and their performance ratios and scores for the Efficiency Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) measure. Medicare makes incentive payments to hospitals based on how well they perform on each measure and how much they improve their performance on each measure compared to their performance during a baseline period. Hospital Compare Clinical Process of Care Outcome Scores contains a list of hospitals participating in the Hospital Value Based Purchasing Program and their performance rates and scores for the outcome measures. This data package also includes a list of hospitals participating in the Hospital Compare and their Clinical Process of Care domain scores, Patient Experience of Care dimension scores, and Total Performance Scores. CMS assesses each hospital\u2019s total performance by comparing its Achievement and Improvement scores for each applicable Hospital Value Based Purchasing measure. CMS uses a threshold and benchmark to determine how many points to award for the achievement and improvement scores. CMS compares the achievement and Improvement scores and uses whichever is greater. --- ## License Information The use of John Snow Labs datasets is free for personal and research purposes.

AINAR Contextual Ad Breaks was specifically created for AVOD and FAST services, aiming to increase advertising revenue while providing a seamless viewing experience for audiences. By leveraging the latest advances in computer vision and machine learning, AINAR Contextual Ad Breaks accurately and efficiently detects natural advertisement breaks in video assets. This means that commercials are placed at the natural cue points in the story, avoiding the disruption of gripping scenes or important dialogues. <br> <br> Our research have shown that over 64% of people abandon AVODs due to a poor ad experience and with our product, viewers will not have to endure commercials randomly placed in the middle of an important scene. <br> <br> Hyper-Targeted Advertising with Contextual Analysis <br> <br> AINAR's advanced technology accurately detects faces, actions, scenes, emotions, and moods, allowing for targeted ad placements aligned with the content being consumed. Through contextual ad breaks and detailed scene analysis, AINAR enables hyper-targeting, resulting in increased impressions and conversions. By understanding the power of storytelling, AINAR has developed the Contextual Ad-Break Tool, which utilizes deep learning and artificial intelligence to analyze the context, sentiments, and emotions of movies or TV shows. By identifying scenarios within the content that match pre-defined parameters, the tool suggests accurate ad placements with the right mood and tone. The outcome is an ad experience where viewers don't feel ads are randomly inserted during engaging scenes or crucial dialogues. Contextual ad breaks keep viewers engaged with the platform and provide better ROI for advertisers. <br> <br> AINAR Ad Breaks go beyond simply identifying black frames. It considers changes in mood levels, storytelling, speech, scene boundary detection, and more to determine the probability of a suitable ad break. AINAR Ad-Breaks categorizes breaks into three ranks: black frame and type of scene transition/break, primary breaks, and secondary breaks. This allows content owners to prioritize and tier their advertisement inventory, tailoring the ad experience to each piece of content. Leveraging Vionlabs mood analysis, AINAR exposes information about the sentiment of the scene before heading into the ad break, enabling advertisers to target based on the content's mood and sentiment. With advanced deep learning and AI capabilities, advertisers can have confidence that their ads will be placed in the most effective context, leading to better engagement and more successful campaigns. <br> <br> Our Contextual Ad Breaks can be delivered with millisecond or frame accuracy, ensuring the success of any FAST or AVOD service.",
